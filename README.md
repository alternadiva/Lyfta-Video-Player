### Vision 

Create a video player with a customized interface. 📺

### Selected User Story 

**As a user, I'd like to see a progress bar as the video is being played, so I can keep tracking the status of it #3**

#### Subtasks:

- [x] Add progress bar
- [x] Set the range
- [x] Update the value as the video progresses

▶️ To test the progress bar on the UI, I had to complete user story #1 and #2 as well. ⏸
