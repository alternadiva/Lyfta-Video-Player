### User Stories

As a user ...
- I'd like to play the video by clicking the video itself or a button, so I can decide when to start
- I'd like to pause the video by clicking the video itself or a button, so I can decide when to stop
- I'd like to see a progress bar as the video is being played, so I can keep tracking the status of it
- I want to control the volume on a slider so I can adjust it with my mouse
- I want to mute and unmute the video when necessary
- I'd like to see the duration of the video and the time elapsed when the video is being played so I know when to expect the end
- I'd like to have the option to use the full-screen mode
- I'd like to use keyboard shortcuts so I can control the player with my keyboard
